# frenchWebsite

It's a Website for a french Project, which was originally designed to be just a questionaire, but we took the opportunity and made a programming challenge out of it, to practice HTML, CSS and back-end development with PHP as well as to get more used to GIT and GITHUB

We worked on this for around for days and I'm very proud of the progress. This is a one time project, so there probably won't be any more developing in the future, but as I said we both (Saleh and Timon) are very proud of what we've achieved even if we won't get a hundred on the project.

The Website only allows one answer per IP-Adress and you can reset everything by typing in the password: "Reset all Statistics and IP adresses! - Signed Moman" in the last textarea
